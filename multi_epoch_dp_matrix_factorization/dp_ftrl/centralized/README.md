This directory contains the code for running training in the centralized
setting.

The file `xm_experiment_definitions.py` contains all the grids used for our
CIFAR-10 experiments. The grids for fft (also defined separately in
`xm_fft_experiment_definitions.py`), are also accessible from
`xm_experiment_definitions.py`.
